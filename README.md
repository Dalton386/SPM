# Subtype-specific Pathway Linear Progression Model

An integer linear program for simultaneous identification of cancer pathways, cancer subtyes and subtype-specific order of pathway dysregulation. The input is the Cancer Cell Fraction (CCF) matrix with rows corresponding to samples and columns indicating somatic genetic variants for which CCF values are measured. The output consists of a partitioning samples into subtypes, a partitioning of variants into pathways, and a linear progression model of the pathways for each subtype.
